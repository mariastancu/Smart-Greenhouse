        <strong>Cultivation Process:</strong><br>
        <strong>Seed Selection and Germination:</strong> Choose varieties suited to your climate. Start seeds indoors 8-10 weeks before the last frost date.<br>
        <strong>Transplanting:</strong> Transplant seedlings outdoors after the last frost when they are 6-8 weeks old and have at least two sets of true leaves.<br>
        <strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Peppers thrive in well-drained, fertile soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8. Incorporate organic matter to improve soil structure and fertility.<br>
        <strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 45-60 cm apart in rows 60-90 cm apart. Plant seedlings at the same depth they were in their pots.<br>
        <strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Use drip irrigation or soaker hoses to avoid wetting the foliage.<br>
        <strong>Fertilizing:</strong> Apply a balanced fertilizer at planting and switch to a fertilizer higher in potassium and phosphorus once fruits start to form.<br>
        <strong>Pruning and Staking:</strong> Prune early flowers to encourage strong growth and use stakes or cages to support plants as they grow.<br>
        <strong>Pest and Disease Management:</strong> Monitor for common pests like aphids and diseases like bacterial spot. Use organic or chemical controls as necessary.<br>
        <strong>Harvesting:</strong> Harvest peppers when they reach the desired size and color. Bell peppers are typically harvested green, but they can also be left to mature to red, yellow, or orange.<br>
        <strong>Environmental Parameters:</strong><br>
        <strong>Soil Humidity:</strong> 60-80%<br>

        <strong>Cultivation Process:</strong><br>
        <strong>Seed Selection and Germination:</strong> Choose disease-resistant varieties. Start seeds indoors 3-4 weeks before the last frost date or sow directly into the garden after the last frost.<br>
        <strong>Transplanting:</strong> Transplant seedlings outdoors when they have at least two sets of true leaves and the risk of frost has passed.<br>
        <strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Cucumbers prefer well-drained, fertile soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8. Adding compost or aged manure improves soil fertility and texture.<br>
        <strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 30-45 cm apart in rows 90-150 cm apart. Use trellises to support vine growth and save space.<br>
        <strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist, providing 1-2 inches of water per week. Avoid overhead watering to prevent fungal diseases.<br>
        <strong>Fertilizing:</strong> Apply a balanced fertilizer at planting and side-dress with compost or a high-potassium fertilizer during the growing season.<br>
        <strong>Pest and Disease Management:</strong> Monitor for pests like cucumber beetles and diseases like powdery mildew. Use organic or chemical controls as necessary.<br>

        <p>Wheat (Triticum spp.) is a staple grain crop grown worldwide, used to produce flour for bread, pasta, and other food products. It is rich in carbohydrates, fiber, and protein.</p>
        <strong>Cultivation Process:</strong><br>
        <strong>Seed Selection and Planting:</strong> Choose high-yield, disease-resistant varieties. Sow seeds directly into the field in the fall for winter wheat or in the spring for spring wheat.<br>
        <strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Wheat prefers well-drained, loamy soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Tillage and incorporation of organic matter improve soil structure and fertility.<br>
        <strong>Planting:</strong> Plant seeds at a depth of 2-5 cm, with a spacing of 15-25 cm between rows.<br>
        <strong>Watering:</strong> Wheat requires consistent moisture, especially during germination and early growth stages. Irrigate as needed to maintain soil moisture.<br>
        <strong>Fertilizing:</strong> Apply a balanced fertilizer based on soil test results. Nitrogen is particularly important for wheat growth and yield.<br>
        <strong>Pest and Disease Management:</strong> Monitor for pests like aphids and diseases like rust. Use integrated pest management (IPM) practices and apply pesticides as necessary.<br>
        <strong>Harvesting:</strong> Harvest wheat when the grain is fully mature and dry. Combine harvesters are typically used for large-scale harvesting.<br>
        <strong>Environmental Parameters:</strong><br>
        <strong>Soil Humidity:</strong> 50-70%<br>
        <strong>Air Quality:</strong> Ensure good air circulation to reduce the risk of fungal diseases. Avoid high pollution levels.<br>
        <strong>Air Humidity:</strong> 40-60%<br>
        <strong>Air Temperature:</strong> Daytime: 15-24°C, Nighttime: 10-16°C<br>
        <strong>Light Intensity:</strong> Full sun, 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day, 400-700 µmol/m²/s (PAR)<br>
        <strong>UV Intensity:</strong> Moderate UV-B levels can be beneficial for growth, but excessive UV exposure can cause damage to the plants.<br>
